In a single query, if the first name of the actor is currently `HARPO`, change it to `GROUCHO`. Otherwise, change the first name to `MUCHO GROUCHO`, as that is exactly what the actor will be with the grievous error. BE CAREFUL NOT TO CHANGE THE FIRST NAME OF EVERY ACTOR TO `MUCHO GROUCHO`, HOWEVER! (Hint: update the record using a unique identifier.)
